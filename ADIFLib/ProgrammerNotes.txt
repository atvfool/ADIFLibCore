20191012 -	This is really ADIFLib version 2.  Why?  Version 1 was getting far too top heavy.  
			The focus of the first attempt seemed to be aiming twards validation of the 
			ADIF structure and data.  After considerable work, I realized the initial focus
			should have been on parsing, import and export.  This top-heavy version seemed to
			be collapsing under the weight of validation, where parsing, import and export
			seemed to be drowning.  RIP version 1, welcome version 2.
