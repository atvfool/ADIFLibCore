Programmer's Notes for ADIFLib

Classes
ADIF -			This represents an ADIF file or collection of ADIFQSO items.
ADIFQSO -		This represents an ADIF QSO item.  Basically, this is a single
				detail line in an ADIF file.  
ADIFHeader -	This represents the ADIF header.
Token -			Internal class specifically meant to represent, parse and export a single 
				ADIF token.  What is an adif token?  Simple, it is a single unit of 
				information within an ADIF record.  For example, <CALL:4>NV9U   This is
				an ADIF token.

20191012 -	This is really ADIFLib version 2.  Why?  Version 1 was getting far too top heavy.  
			The focus of the first attempt seemed to be aiming twards validation of the 
			ADIF structure and data.  After considerable work, I realized the initial focus
			should have been on parsing, import and export.  This top-heavy version seemed to
			be collapsing under the weight of validation, where parsing, import and export
			seemed to be drowning.  RIP version 1, welcome version 2.
