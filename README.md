# ADIFLib
C# Library to read and parse ADIF files. 

This is a simple library for reading and parsing ADIF files.  ADIF files are typically used in ham radio applications but could be used by other applications as well.  

ADIFLib simply reads an ADIF file into a C# List of Dictionary items that represent the columns within the ADIF file.  There are many import options that can be used.  Contextural validation of the imported data is not not performed.

If you need an ADIF parser, I hope you enjoy this library, whether it is for an an Amateur Radio application or not.
