# ADIFLib
C# Library to read and parse ADIF files. 

This is a simple library for creating, reading and parsing ADIF files.  It is the goal of this library to closely support ADIF version 3.1.0

ADIF files are typically used in ham radio applications to exchange information.  Detailed information about the various ADIF specifications can be found here:  http://www.adif.org/

If you need an ADIF parser for your amateur radio program, I hope you enjoy this library.
